# 👉 Day 29: Secret One: end

## Secret One: end

You can already create `print` statements like a boss, but there are a few things you can do to make them easier.

Let's add a few secret second arguments to the `print` statement and see what happens.

By default, at the end of every `print` statement, the computer clicks 'enter'.

👉 Remember, how a range of numbers shows each number on a new line...

```python
for i in range(0, 100):
  print(i)
```

### Add a space

👉 Let's tweak that code and see if we can get it to print with a space between each number instead of a new line. What do you notice?

```python
for i in range(0, 100):
  print(i, end=" ")
```

## Add a space and comma

👉 What if we want to add a comma and a space? Let's try it by adding `,` to our argument.

```python
for i in range(0, 100):
  print(i, end=", ")
```

Now this looks like a proper list!

### Add a new line, tab, or vertical tab


👉 What happens if you add these different options in your second argument? Play around with these options below and see what they do:

```python
#new line
for i in range(0, 100):
  print(i, end="\n")
```

```python
#tab indent
for i in range(0, 100):
  print(i, end="\t")
```

```python
#vertical tab
for i in range(0, 100):
  print(i, end="\v")
```

### Play around with `end`. What can it do?

## Secret Two: sep

(Wait...why are we still using `end` when this chapter is about secret two, `sep`? Just hold tight...)

### Color Changing with end...

👉 I can turn the colors on and off different bits of the code by using `end`. Remove the previous code from your `day28.py` file and try this out.


```python
print("If you put")
print("\033[33m", end="") #yellow
print("nothing as the")
print("\033[35m", end="") #purple
print("end character")
print("\033[32m", end="") #green
print("then you don't")
print("\033[0m", end="") #default
print("get odd gaps")
```

👉 Let's concatenate that same `print` statement:

```python
print("If you put", "\033[33m", "nothing as the", "\033[35m", "end character", "\033[32m", "then you don't", "\033[0m", "get odd gaps", end="")

```

Now you may notice that we are getting weird double spaces in between the different sections. Let's fix that!

### Color changing with sep...

👉 Take this same code and change `end` to `sep` (short for separator) and add a space at the end of each string. What happens?

```python
print("If you put ", "\033[33m", "nothing as the ", "\033[35m", "end character ", "\033[32m", "then you don't ", "\033[0m", "get odd gaps ", sep="")
```

#### This is a much easier way to control spacing in random text or emojis too!




## Secret Three: Cursor
David, you muppet! Why are we doing this again? We already learned this...

👉 Do you notice how difficult this is to read?


```python
import os

for i in range(1, 101):
  print(i)
  os.system("clear")
```

Your probably thinking...David, `import time`:

👉 Let's do it, but is there anything you still notice?

```python
import os, time

for i in range(1, 101):
  print(i)
  time.sleep(0.5)
  os.system("clear")
```

### That GIANT white cursor...

I bet you didn't even know we could turn that off! It is just a sneaky `print` command.

👉 Let's try the same code, but turn the cursor off:

```python
import os, time
print('\033[?25l', end="")
for i in range(1, 101):
  print(i)
  time.sleep(0.2)
  os.system("clear")
```

What if we want to turn the cursor back on:

## 👉 Day 29 Challenge

- Write a subroutine that writes text in color. All it will do is print out the text in that color and turn the color back to normal when it's finished.

- Control `end` and `sep` so there are not random symbols or spaces.

- Check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/rene-d/9e584a7dd2935d0f461904b9f2950007" target="_blank">this github resource</a>  for the color codes.

<summary>💡 Hint</summary>

- Create a subroutine with a variable for 'word' and 'color' through the use of if statements. Here is an example of how to include the color red:

```python
 if color=="red":
    print("\033[31m", word, sep="", end="")
```

- `print` your title 'Super Subroutine' and 'with my' as regular `print` statements.
- `print` the rest of the text in different colors by calling the subroutine.

```python
def newPrint(color, word):
  if color=="red":
    print("\033[31m", word, sep="", end="")
  elif color=="green":
    print("\033[32m", word, sep="", end="")
  elif color=="blue":
    print("\033[34m", word, sep="", end="")
  else:
    print("\033[0m", word, sep="", end="")

print("Super Subroutine")
print("With my ", end="")
newPrint("red", "new program")
newPrint("reset", " I can just call red('and') ")
newPrint("red", "it will print in red ")
newPrint("blue", "or even blue")
```
