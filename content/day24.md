# 👉 Day 24: Parameters

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEpcNiqV73k" target="_blank">Dāvida video</a>

I get it. So far, subroutines have been a bit underwhelming...

Let's put those subroutines to better use by sending them information using parameters and making them do different things based on different inputs.

If you change the ingredients in a recipe, you get a different kind of cake. Let's do that with subroutines.

In a subroutine, the `()` are for the argument (FYI argument is another word for parameter). These are the pieces of information we pass to the code. These can be variable names that are made up for the first time within the argument `()`.

Here is a simple subroutine that uses the argument to take in the name of an ingredient and expresses its opinion (quite strongly) about the ingredient that the user typed. For example, 'chocolate' is amazing, but 'broccoli'...not so much.

👉 Try it out.

```python
def whichCake(ingredient):
  if ingredient == "chocolate":
    print("Mmm, chocolate cake is amazing")
  elif ingredient == "broccoli":
    print("You what mate?!")
  else:
    print("Yeah, that's great I suppose...")
```

### But how do we call it?

## How do we call the subroutine?

We call it in the same way as before. However, instead of leaving the `()` blank, we send the code a message.

👉 What happens when you add this to the end of your code above?

```python
whichCake("chocolate")
```

That's right. The variable 'ingredient' in the subroutine gets set to 'chocolate' and the output shows:

### 👉 What happens if you change "ingredient" to "broccoli"?

## Adding More Arguments

We can have as many arguments as we want, separated by commas.

Now, this subroutine is expecting three arguments: ingredient, base, and coating:

```python
def whichCake(ingredient, base, coating)
```

👉 Let's update our code to now show all three arguments:

```python
def whichCake(ingredient, base, coating):
  if ingredient == "chocolate":
    print("Mmm, chocolate cake is amazing")
  elif ingredient == "broccoli":
    print("You what mate?!")
  else:
    print("Yeah, that's great I suppose...")
  print("So you want a", ingredient, "cake on a", base, "base with", coating, "on top?")
whichCake("carrot", "biscuit", "icing")
```

👉 I could even ask the user to name an ingredient, base, and coating by adding:

```python
def whichCake(ingredient, base, coating):
  if ingredient == "chocolate":
    print("Mmm, chocolate cake is amazing")
  elif ingredient == "broccoli":
    print("You what mate?!")
  else:
    print("Yeah, that's great I suppose...")
  print("So you want a", ingredient, "cake on a", base, "base with", coating, "on top?")

userIngredient = input("Name an ingredient: ")
userBase = input("Name a type of base: ")
userCoating = input("Fave cake topping: ")
whichCake(userIngredient, userBase, userCoating)
```

### What could you input to make a yummy cake?

### Invalid Syntax

```python
def biggerNumber(number1 number2):
  if(number1 > number2):
    print(number 1, "is bigger")
  else:
    print(number 2, "is bigger")
biggerNumber (18,332)
```

You need a `,`. Remember, you have to add a comma in between each variable that you expect to be a parameter. You can have as many arguments as you want. Remember, though, if you create two arguments, you must also call two arguments.

```python
def biggerNumber(number1, number2):
  if(number1 > number2):
    print(number1, "is bigger")
  else:
    print(number2, "is bigger")

biggerNumber (18,332)
```

## 👉 Day 24 Challenge

Let's build an infinity dice!

- Create subroutines that will roll a dice with any number of sides (essentially as big of a number as you like). Write one subroutine with one parameter that allows us to call a function (such as rollDice).

```python
Example:
Infinity Dice 🎲
How many sides?: 600
You rolled 532
Roll again? yes
You rolled 102
Roll again? no
```

<details>
<summary>💡 Hint</summary>

- Import your library first.
- Create a variable to ask the user how many sides the dice should be.
- Create a variable that allows the user to leave the game.
- Create a subroutine with rollDice that sets the sides of the dice as the argument.
- Create a `while` loop that allows the user to roll again or leave the game.

## Solution (No Peeking!)

<summary>👀 Answer</summary>

```python
import random
print("Infinity Dice 🎲")

sides = int(input("How many sides?: "))
playGame = "yes"

def rollDice(sides):
  print("You rolled ", random.randint(1,sides))
while playGame == "yes":
    rollDice(sides)
    playGame = input("Roll again?")
```
